      My name is Dev Malani, I am a Junior Software Engineer with one years
      worth of experience in Software Engineer and Development that was gained
      through internships and professional engagements. I hold a bachelorâ€™s
      degree in computer science from Kennesaw State University and am
      proficient in various programming languages and technologies such as Java,
      Python, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, GitHub, Postman, AWS, and Azure. My
      passion fall into the full-stack web development realm which sparked
      during my role at OncoHealth as a Software Engineer. OncoHealth is a
      prestigious healthcare company specializing in case management for cancer
      patients where insurance providers such as Excellus BCBS, Humana,
      Triple-S, Alignment Healthcare, etc. provides us with cases and our review
      specialists will review each case individually alongside with the clinical
      and life science team. Once reviewed and approved, we send them back to
      the insurance providers in form of audit reports. My primary
      responsibility was to work closely with these review specialists,
      clinical, and life science team to enhance our website's functionality
      and/or any updates needed for the cases. Some technologies that I have
      used at OncoHealth, includes both ASP.NET and .NET core with C#, Angular,
      and Microsoft SQL Server for full-stack purposes, Zendesk for production
      support, Azure for Cloud Infrastructure, and Azure DevOps for source
      control, CI/CD, and task prioritization. On the contrary, I had the
      privilege to intern at Equifax as a Software Developer. Equifax is an
      agency that collects and maintains information on credit histories of
      individuals and businesses, including credit scores, payment history, and
      other financial data. This information is used by lenders, landlords,
      employers, and others to assess creditworthiness and make decisions about
      extending credit or services. My primary responsibility as a Software
      Developer Intern was mainly to test and build API endpoints and create
      test cases for certain services. Some technologies that I have used at
      Equifax are Spring using Java, GitHub for source control, SonarQube for
      software management, JIRA for task prioritization, and Postman for testing
      API endpoints. I am eager to further my skills in this dynamic field as it
      is one of the few fields that is ever so growing with new technologies
      emerging everyday. To learn more about me, please visit the Skills,
