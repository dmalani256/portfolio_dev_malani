      My name is Dev Malani, I am Junior Software Engineer with one year
      of experience gained through internships and professional engagements. I
      hold a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science from Kennesaw State
      University and am proficient in Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript,
      GitHub, Postman, AWS, and Azure. My passion for full-stack web development
      was sparked during my role at OncoHealth, a healthcare company
      specializing in case management for cancer patients, where I enhanced
      website functionality using ASP.NET, .NET Core, Angular, and Microsoft SQL
      Server. I also interned at Equifax, where I built and tested API endpoints
      using Spring, GitHub, SonarQube, JIRA, and Postman. Eager to further my
      skills, I am excited about the opportunity to join your team and
      contribute to its success. For more about me, please see my Skills,
      Experience, and Education tabs.
