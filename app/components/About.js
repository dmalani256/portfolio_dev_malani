      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Dev Malani, and I am an aspiring Junior Software Engineer with 1 years’
        worth of experience in Software Engineer and Development that I have accumulated
        from internships and professional engagements throughout my collegiate
        years and after graduation. Having a bachelor’s degree in computer science
        from Kennesaw State University, I have gained practical experience in
        various programming languages and technologies such as Java, Python, C#,
        JavaScript, TypeScript, GitHub, PostMan, AWS, Azure, and etc. My enthusiasm 
        particularly lies in full-stack web development realm, which stems from my previous 
        role as a Software Engineer at OncoHealth. OncoHealth is a prominent healthcare company that
        specializes in case management for cancer patients. In which we get cases
        from insurance providers such as Excellus BCBS, Humana, Triple-S,
        and Alignment Healthcare and our review specialists will review each
        case individually and once reviewed, we send them back to the insurance
        providers in audit reports. My primary responsibility was to work closely
        with these review specialists, clinical, and life science team to enhance
        our website's functionality and/or any updates needed for the cases. Some
        technologies that I have used at OncoHealth, includes both ASP.NET and
        .NET core with C#, Angular using TypeScript, and Microsoft SQL Server for
        full-stack development, Zendesk for production support, Azure for Cloud
        Infrastructure, and Azure DevOps for source control, CI/CD, task
        prioritization etc. Before joining OncoHealth, I had the privilege of
        interning at Equifax as a Software Developer. Equifax is a renowned consumer credit
        reporting agency where they collect and maintain information on credit histories of individuals and
        businesses, including credit scores, payment history, and other financial
        data. This information is used by lenders, landlords, employers, and
        others to assess creditworthiness and make decisions about extending
        credit or services. My primary responsibility as a Software Developer
        Intern was mainly to test and build API endpoints and create test cases
        for certain services. Some technologies that I have used at Equifax are
        Spring using Java, GitHub for source control, SonarQube for software
        management, JIRA for task prioritization, and Postman for testing API
        endpoints. I am eager to continue expanding my knowledge and skills in
        this dynamic field, and I believe that joining your team will contribute
        significantly to my professional growth. To get to know alittle bit more about me
